												  My Portfolio

I have created an online portfolio that gives you an idea about my background, professional experience, skills etc.

The site has been created using HTML Tags and CSS classes. The images, videos and other documents used in the webpage are stored in the assets folder.

I have included HTML Tags such as : 
						<section> : It is used for splitting the whole webpage into fragments. There are total 5 sections.

						<div> : Used for defining containers inside the sections. A common max-width was defined for each of the continers to 
							  maintain the responsiveness of the site.
  
						<span> : Used for adding extra classes on elements inside a div tag.

						<H1>,<H2> : Heading and sub headings are defined under this tag.

						<p> : Normal text for the site was defined under paragraph tag.

						<figure> : Each image was defined under a figure tag to maintiain the common class on multiple images under sections.

						<img> : For adding images to my portfolio from the assets folder

						<small> : For defining dates in the site, this tag was used.

						<br> : For splitting the lines of a paragraph into next line, this tag was used.

						<hr> : I had to provide a horizontal line in the education section to split the section into two for a better UI.

						<html> : It is necessary for running an html file.
 
						<head> : The meta data and title of the project are defined in this tab.

						<title> : The title of the project that is, My Portfolio is defined in this tag.

						<body> : The whole html script is written in between this tag. The 5 sections and the footer.

						<script> : The icons used in the file are font awesome icons and this tag is used to get the icons.

						<meta> : The initial view port of the site and the browser imformation is provided.

						<link> : The css file is linked under this tag.

						<nav> : Navigation panel is build under this tag for better defination.

						<a> : For navigating to different parts of the site, the anchor tag was used. 
							ID for specific section were defined for carrying out this task. 

						<ul> : Unordered list is used for defining the list of items in the navigation panel.

						<li> : Indivdual list element is defined under this tag.

						<i> : Icons used on the site are defined under this tag.

						<img> : The images used with there source url and alternate text are defined using this tag.

						<footer> : The contact information and back to top button is displayed using the footer tag towards the end of the page.

I have also used basic and advanced css properties for beautifying the whole page. Some of the properties that were used includes, overflow, box-shadow,
display, flex-direction, animation, transform, align items, z-index, max-width etc.
